# 7. Getting The Right Docker and Compose Versions

```
The rest of this section is on Docker Compose.
But, I want to make sure you have the latest tools that
you're going to need for this course.
That's not very many tools, really.
I won't talk too much about that.
You're just going to use whatever Node version you prefer.
A lot of this course is using Node in a container, so we'll
worry about that later.
Let's focus on the Docker tools.
The two tools you'll need will be Docker, the engine in
command line that we all think of as Docker
That's the preferred option.
It's the thing that Docker spends all their time on
nowadays, and they keep adding features and improving
performance. If you're on an older version of Windows,
or Windows 10 Home, none of those have Hyper-V.
That's what's required in order to use Docker Desktop.
So, on those versions, you'll look up Docker
It just won't have all the latest and greatest Docker
features that Desktop might have.
If you're on a Linux distribution for your main desktop,
or if you're interested in installing on a server,
when I started planning this stuff.
Those are the versions that have all the new features that
you will use throughout this course.
So, I rarely see an issue with newer versions breaking
anything in my courses.
So, just get the latest stuff, and let's get
into Docker Compose.
