This course relies heavily on Docker Compose, which

is a tool designed for local dev and test

to make it easier for Docker workflows.

In fact, Docker built the tool designing it around the

typical workflow of a dev test prod lifecycle

where you're going to be building a bunch of stuff on your

local machine, and then eventually ship it off.

It's a great tool.

We're going spend a lot of time on it in this course.It's

really going to help you save some time.

If you're new to it, this section is going to focus on

the CLI and the file format for using Docker Compose.

If you're not new to it maybe it's a good review

anyway. It's got an assignment at the end to make sure that

you've got the basics down before we start jumping heavily

into using Docker Compose day to day.
