We're back to talking about images, again, in this section.

It's a level up from the previous sections on images.

In the past, you've learned about good, efficient images

using all the features of Dockerfiles, the modern features

like BuildKit and multistage, and all that stuff for really

getting great Node Dockerfiles.

Now, we're going to focus on specific features to layer

on top of that, just for production, to make sure

that you have all the last, little tidbits for your

production workloads. Before, we were really focused, a

little, bit on development and testing.

Now, we're going to add in those production features on top

of that. I've got some good assignments in there that you

should definitely use to retain knowledge and to test

whether you were paying attention.

Once you're done with this section, you're really going to

have a one-two punch on image building

using all the latest features for both dev and production

workloads in the same Dockerfiles.

That's a really great thing that we have finally in

2018-2019.

You're going to learn all about the rest of those features

in this section.
