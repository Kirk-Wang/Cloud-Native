Docker was designed for the cloud.

It works great everywhere but it really works

well when you're focusing your apps on

12 factor design patterns.

You maybe don't know what that is yet. But, you're going to

learn in this section about design optimization

for things that are distributed.

And, the cloud is distributed.

In fact, your data centers are probably becoming more and

more distributed, so you definitely want to understand

these principles so that your Node apps are using the best

parts of Docker they can.

You're also going to learn, in this section, about the

dockerignore file that's similar to the gitignore.

That will help you keep things out of your images that you

don't want. You're going to do an assignment that's very

much like real-world stuff that I do all the time.

Which is take existing Node apps and migrate them into

containers. Even old Node apps that you maybe

need old setups and design.
