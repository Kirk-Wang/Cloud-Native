Now this course is not going to be heavy CI/CD.

We're not learning how to build CI systems here

or do Continuous Deployment.

That is really not anything Node specific.

Those things just work the way they work with all Docker

images and containers.

Again, I've got to give you some tips because I see so many

people out there working on projects and

learning the hard way like I had to do years ago.

I want to give you some of my experience.

Here's some quick hit items that you want to check on

if you're working on CI and CD solutions with your Node

apps. Or really any apps.
