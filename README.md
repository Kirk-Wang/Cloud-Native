# Cloud-Native-And-DevOps

### Check Our Tools

* Docker Desktop preferred(Win/Mac)
* Docker Toolbox(Win 7/8/10 Home)
* Linux: Install via Docker Docs
  * [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com)

### Getting Docker Compose
* CLI: docker-compose
  * Included in Docker Desktop & Toolbox
  * Linux: pip install docker-compose

```sh
docker version
# xx
docker-compose version
# xx
```

### Why Compose?
* 2 parts: CLI and YAML files
* Designed around developer workflows
* docker-compose CLI a substitute for docker CLI
* Use CLI by default locally

**OOPS!~I meant to say "I reccomend you use Docker Compose locally"**

### Compose File Format
* Docker standard (not yet industry std)
* Defines multiple containers, networks, volumes, etc.
* Can layer sets of YAML files, use templates, variables, and more
* docker-compose.yml default

### YAML
**YAML: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"**
* Common configuration file format
* Used by Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon, and others
* : used for key/value pairs
* Only spaces, no tabs
* - used for lists

### Compose YAML v2 vs V3
* Myth busting: v3 does not replace v2
* v2 focus: single-node dev/test
* v3 focus: muti-node orchestration
* If not using Swarm/Kubernetes, stick to v2

### docker-compose CLI
* many docker commands == docker-compose
* IDE's now support docker-compose
* "batteries included, but swappable"
* CLI and YAML versions differ

### docker-compose up
* "one stop shop"
* build/pull image(s) if missing
* create volume/network/container(s)
* starts containers(s) in foregound(-d to detach)
* --build to always build

### docker-compose down
* "one stop shop"
* stop and delete network/container(s)
* use -v to delete volumes

### docker-compose...
* Many commands take "service" option
* **build** just build/rebuild image(s)
* **stop** just stop containers don't delete
* **ps** list "services"
* **push** images to registry
* **logs** same as docker CLI
* **exec** same as docker CLI

### Compose CLI Basics-1
* Run through simple compose commands
```sh
cd sample-02
docker-compose up
ctrl-c (same as docker-compose stop)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs
```
* While app is running detached...
```sh
docker-compose exec web sh
curl localhost
exit
```
* edit Dockerfile, add curl with apk
```sh
RUN apk add --update curl
docker-compose up -d
```
* Notice it didn't build so force it 
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```
* Now try curl again
```sh
docker-compose exec web sh
curl localhost
exit
```

### Cleanup
* Inside sample-02 directory
```sh
docker-compose down
docker-compose down --helps
```

### Compose CLI Basics-2

* build no chace
```sh
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
* `docker-compose ps`
```sh
sample-02_web_1   docker-entrypoint.sh node  ...   Up      0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
```
  * `sample-02` -> name of the project
  * `web` -> name of the service
  * `1` -> numerical number of the replica

open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* `docker-machine ls`
* `docker-compose logs`
```sh
docker-compose logs web
```
* `docker-compose exec`
```sh
docker-compose exec web sh
curl localhost
```
* add `RUN apk add --update curl` to `Dockerfile`
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec web sh
curl localhost
curl localhost:3000
docker-compose down
```

### Dockerfile Node Basics

[Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

* COPY, not ADD
* npm/yarn install during build
* CMD node, not npm 
  * requires another application to run
  * not as literal in Dockerfiles
  * doesn't work well as an init or PID 1 process
* WORKDIR not RUN mkdir
  * Unless you need chown

### FROM Base Image Guidelines

[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)|
[Node.js Release Schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule)|
[GitHub: ONBUILD deprecation](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues/2076)|
[Node Official Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)

* Stick to even numbered major releases
* Don't use :latest tag
* Start with Debian if migrating
* Move to Alpline later
* Don't use :slim
* Don't use :onbuild

### When to use Alpine Images
* Alpine is "small" and "sec focused"
* But Debian/Ubuntu are smaller now too
* ~100MB space savings isn't significant
* Alpine has its own issues
* Alpine CVE scanning fails
* Enterprises may require CentOS or Ubuntu/Debian

### Making a CentOS Node Image
* Install Node in the official CentOS
* Copy Dockerfile lines frome node:10
* Use ENV to specify node version
* This will take a few tries
* Useful for knowing how to make your own node, but only if you have to

### Assignment Answers:Making a CentOS Node Image

**NOTE: You must add 'USER node' before CMD in Dockerfile to enable non-root user**

```yml
# Dockfile
RUN groupadd --gid 1000 node \
  && useradd --uid 1000 --gid node --shell /bin/bash --create-home node
```

build
```sh
docker build -t centos-node .
docker run centos-node node --version
```

### Least Privilege: Using node User
* Official node images have a node user
* But it's not used by default
* Do this after `apt/apk` and `npm i -g`
* Do this before `npm i`
* May cause permissions issues with write access
* May require `chown node:node`
* Change user from root to node
```sh
USER node
```
* Set permissions on app dir
```sh
RUN mkdir app && chown -R node:node .
```
* Run a command as root in container
```sh
docker-compose exec -u root
```

### Making Images Efficiently
* Pick proper FROM
* Line order matters
* COPY twice: package.json* then . .
  1. copy only the package and lock files
  2. run npm install
  3. copy everything else
* One apt-get per Dockerfile
  * apt-get update cache prob

### Node Process Management In Containers
* No need for nodemon, forever, or pm2 on server
  * We'll use nodemon in dev for file watch later
* Docker manages app start, stop, restart, healthcheck
* Node multi-thread: Docker manages multiple "replicas"
* One npm/node problem: They don't listen for proper shutdown signal by default

### The Truth About The PID 1 Problem
* PID 1 (Process Identifier) is the first process in a system (or container) (AKA init)
* Init process in a container has two jobs:
  * reap zombie processes
  * pass signals to sub-processes
* Zombie not a big Node issue
* Focus on proper Node shutdown

### Proper CMD for Healthy Shutdown
* Docker uses Linux signals to stop app (SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
* SIGINT/SIGTERM allow graceful stop
* npm doesn't respond to SIGINT/SIGTERM
* node doesn't respond by default, but can with code
* Docker provides a init PID 1 replacement option
