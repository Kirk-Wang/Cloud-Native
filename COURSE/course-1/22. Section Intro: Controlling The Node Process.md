This section is a good one because we're going to be

talking about the specifics of Node

and how it runs in a container.

Specifically, how do we deal with it shutting down,

starting up, and the Linux systems

that control what's going on that container.

The thing is that a lot of people gloss over this part, or

read outdated, or just plain wrong, blog entries

about how to deal with the problem of Node

being controlled properly inside a container.

Specifically how does it shut down and properly get

replaced. And so I wanted to focus on that for a

whole section and give you some good assignments to deal

with this problem and understand the various options you

have and which ones you should use when.
