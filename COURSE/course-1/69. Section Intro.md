You spent so much time in this course and now it's

all coming together. You've got your great local

development set up. You've got these great Dockerfiles that

now work in production. You're a Compose Master.

Now, we're going to be talking about deploying to

production and what concerns you need to have with Node.js

specifically, as well as common problems that people

deploying containers for the first time might have in

production that will help you with Node.js.

Node.js is often used for Web frameworks, Web apps, so

there is some bonus stuff in here around that specific

problem using HTTP proxies, and

HTTP connection shutdowns, and stuff like, that

maybe won't be for every Node.js app.

But, certainly a large percentage of the

Node.js apps out there are Web protocol based using

HTTP.

You're going to be learning some of that stuff including

when not to use Compose in production.

When to use something like Swarm or Kubernetes to learn

about orchestration for Node.js, and some of those concerns

like proxies in connection management.

Then how to replace those in production because, of course,

once you deploy your app, you've got to replace it

eventually with a new version.

Then, looking at some sample files even around Docker

Swarm and Kubernetes in case you're going to look at

orchestration later on.
