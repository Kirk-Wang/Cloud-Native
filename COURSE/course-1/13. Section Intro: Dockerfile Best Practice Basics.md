This section is all about your Node Dockerfiles,

which are going to be the fundamental building blocks for

everything we do for the rest of the course.

To get it out of the way, we're going to jump

into understanding the different types

of Node from images, or which base images you should

use to make sure that you're building the right images, on

the right foundations. Then we'll jump into a quick

assignment just to see how to make your own custom

Node image for something like CentOS that doesn't have a

default image on Docker Hub.

Then I'll go a little bit into how you're going to use

least privilege and increase security to lock down your

Node containers.

We'll also look at some features in the Dockerfile to make

your images efficient, which mostly has to do with size

and speed of building.

That's important once you get to automated CI and

especially when you get to production when you want minimal

size and also speed of deployments.
