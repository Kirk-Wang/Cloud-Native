All right. This section is an important one, and that's

why it's a little larger than the other ones.

It's going to focus on the best parts of local

development setup. Whether you're a DevOps tester,

or you're just a pure operator that is focusing

on testing other people's apps, or maybe you're focusing on

Jenkins and CI/CD deployments, or maybe you're a developer.

All of those need great local environments

for designing and developing container solutions.

You're going to need to have that skill set, including

Docker Compose, which is one of the best ways to do it.

This whole section is all about Compose and

pulling out all the sweet parts of Compose that will work

with Node to make it almost as good as running

native on your native localhost machine.

It is a little bit tricky sometimes to get Node the way you

want it, and I'm solving a lot of those problems for you in

these lectures. So stick with it.

Get through the assignments, which are important for

keeping that learning in your brain and retaining the

knowledge. You'll be thanking me later when you get through

this section on all the new Compose stuff that you have

in your arsenal.
