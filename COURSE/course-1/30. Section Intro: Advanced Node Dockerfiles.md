Now we're getting to some more fun, advanced stuff.

In this section, we're going to focus on some recent

features in the last few years of Docker.

Specifically multistage builds and BuildKit.

Two exciting things that can make it way

easier, more flexible, faster, and a

whole bunch of other stuff, all inside your Docker Node

images. As a part of this, you're going to be doing an

assignment to build a multistage Dockerfile,

which is a pretty cool thing once you understand how to do

it. How do we do that specifically in Node for the most

efficient way possible to make images

that are flexible enough for production and dev, all in

the same Dockerfile.

But, that's not all. I'm throwing in some extra stuff

in here around BuildKit, which is brand new

to the Docker ecosystem, and now a full feature

coming out-of-the-boxthe Docker Engine.

That's going to allow you to do some really neat things,

like throw in your SSH keys during build so you can get

private repos.

Then you could also throw in a caching feature so that your

npm installs cache between builds.
